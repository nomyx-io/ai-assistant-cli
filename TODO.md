## TODO

1. Read the official CoinMarketCap API documentation thoroughly.
2. Identify the main endpoints that the library should support based on the documentation.
3. Set up a new Node.js project with a `package.json` file.
4. Install necessary dependencies such as 'axios' or 'node-fetch' for making HTTP requests.
5. Create a configuration file for storing API keys and other constants.
6. Design the library's API and establish a clear, simple interface for users.
