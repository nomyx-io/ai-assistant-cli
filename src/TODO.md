# Summary

1. **Modularize Configuration Management**: Move configuration loading and saving functionalities into `./src/ConfigurationManager.ts`. This involves extracting `saveConfig`, `loadConfig`, and related configuration utility functions.

2. **Abstract Command Handlers**: Analyze and refactor the `AssistantRun` and `AssistantRunner` classes along with their methods and associated utilities into organized modules considering their responsibilities. This might require breaking down these classes into more specific classes/files like `AssistantManager.ts`, `ThreadManager.ts`, and `MessageManager.ts`.

3. **Refactor Command-Line Argument Parsing**: The logic for parsing command-line arguments (`args`, `flags`, etc.) is to be streamlined and potentially moved into `./src/args.ts` if not optimally implemented, ensuring easy integration and maintainability.

4. **OpenAI API Interaction Management**: The OpenAI API integration and operations (e.g., `getOrCreateAssistant`, `createMessage`, `withRetriesAndTimeouts`, etc.) should be closely reviewed. Depending on their usage, consider creating a dedicated file such as `OpenAIIntegration.ts` that focuses on these interactions.

5. **Optimize Utilities**: Utility functions like `withRetriesAndTimeouts` and `waitIfRateLimited` may be generalized and moved to a `./src/utilities/` directory for reusability across the codebase.

6. **Documentation and Comments**: Alongside refactoring, ensure to document the functionalities, usage, and interactions between the newly created/refactored modules for better maintainability and understanding for future developers.

7. **Testing**: After refactoring, thorough testing must be performed to ensure that all functionalities are preserved and work as expected with the new modular design.
